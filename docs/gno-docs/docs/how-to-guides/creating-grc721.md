# How to create a GRC721 Token (NFT)

## Overview

This guide shows you how to write a simple _GRC721_ Smart Contract, or rather a [Realm](../explanation/realms.md), in [Gnolang (Gno)](../explanation/gno-language.md). For actually deploying the Realm, please see the [deployment](deploy.md) guide.

Our _GRC721_ Realm will have the following functionality:

- Minting a configurable amount of token.
- Keeping track of total token supply.
- Fetching the balance of an account.

## Prerequisites

We will proceed using the typical directory structure for a Realm found within the [simple-contract guide](simple-contract.md). It is also worthwhile to consult the [GRC721 interface](../../../../examples/gno.land/p/demo/grc/grc721/igrc721.gno) which we will be borrowing from within this guide.

## Conclusion

That's it ðŸŽ‰

You have successfully built a simple GRC721 Realm that is ready to be deployed on the Gno chain and called by users.
In the upcoming guides, we will see how we can develop more complex Realm logic and have them interact with outside tools like a wallet application.
